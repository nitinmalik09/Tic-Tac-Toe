# Tic-Tac-Toe
A reinforcement learning agent for playing Tic-Tac-Toe using Q-learning. The agent learns optimal strategies through self-play, updating its Q-table based on game outcomes. Users can play against the agent, which adapts its strategy over time for better decision-making.
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that plays Tic-Tac-Toe using Q-learning. The agent learns optimal strategies through self-play by exploring and exploiting game states. Users can play against the agent, which improves its decision-making over time by updating its Q-table. The system demonstrates the principles of Q-learning and showcases how an agent can optimize its behavior in a game environment.

#Future Works:
	1.	Enhanced Game Complexity: Extend the agent to more complex games (e.g., Connect Four or Chess).
	2.	Deep Q-Learning: Implement Deep Q-Learning to handle larger state spaces with neural networks.
	3.	Opponent Modeling: Develop a system where the agent learns to adapt its strategy based on the opponentâ€™s moves.
	4.	Multiplayer Support: Enable multiplayer functionality
